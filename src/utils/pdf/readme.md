 # PDF to JSON Converter

 This project provides a tool for converting PDF documents to a structured JSON format. It's built using Python, utilizing the `pdfminer.six` library for PDF text extraction and `beautifulsoup4` for HTML parsing.

 ## Features

 - Extract text from PDF files with accurate layout preservation.
 - Convert extracted text into a structured JSON format.
 - Easy integration into Python projects.

 ## Installation

 Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

 ### Dependencies

 Install the required Python libraries using pip:

 ```bash
 pip install pdfminer.six beautifulsoup4
 ```

 ## Project Structure

 ```
 your_project/
 │
 ├── main.py
 │
 └── utils/
     └── pdfminer.py
 ```

 ## Usage

 To use this tool, you need to have a PDF file that you want to convert to JSON format. Place the PDF file in an accessible directory.

 1. **Set Up**: Follow the [Installation](#installation) steps to prepare your environment.
 2. **Convert PDF to JSON**: Run `main.py` with Python, specifying the path to your PDF file in `main.py`.

 ```bash
 python main.py
 ```

 The script will generate a JSON file named `output.json` containing the structured text extracted from the PDF.

 ## Customization

 You can customize the extraction and conversion process by modifying `utils/pdfminer.py` according to your requirements. For instance, you might want to adjust the JSON structure or add more detailed parsing based on the HTML content.
